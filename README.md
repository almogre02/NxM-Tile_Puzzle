# NxM Tile Puzzle
Implemets a search engine that supports several search algorithms to solve the Extanded-NxM-tile-puzzle game on Problems_Solving_By_Search course.
### Using: BFS | DFID | A* | IDA* | DFBnB.

## Launch:

1. javac *.java
 
and than:

2. java Ex1 input.txt

## Input & Output:
Input: In the input.txt you can customize your own board, with start state and goal state (with one or two empty blocks), and choose the size as well.
       You also have to choose wich Algorithm to run at the first line - BFS | DFID | A* | IDA* | DFBnB.

Output: The program will then create an output.txt file with the answer stating the moves for solving the puzzle, the time and cost it took to solve.
